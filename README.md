# Radiation-Emission-Measuring-device

**NCSC (National Children's Science Congress)** hosted a competition to build ideas and perform research on a variety of themes. Our Idea was to research on the radiation emitted by smartphones and work on them.

## Goal:
- Make an Application with the help of Arduino to figure out the measure of Radiation around the user.

### Layout of the App
- Login with Email Authentication + Logout
- Menu to choose which radiation to measure, Ionizing or Non Ionizing
- Measure the radiation using Geiger Counter connected with Bluetooth throught Arduino (For Ionizing)
- Measure the magnetic field strength through Magnetometer sensor (For Non Ionizing)
- The Measurement would be recorded in the database correspondin to the user
