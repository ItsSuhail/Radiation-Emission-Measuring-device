# Radiation-Emission-Measuring-device

**NCSC (National Children's Science Congress)** hosted a competition to build ideas and perform research on a variety of themes. Our Idea was to research on the radiation emitted by smartphones and work on them.

## Idea:
- Research about Radiation emitted by Cellphones
- To first perform a survery and gather data for around 40-50 households
- Try to connect the dots and understand how radiations work and how they are emitted.
- Make an Application with the help of Arduino to figure out the measure of Radiation around the user.
